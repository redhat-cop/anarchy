== Introducing a Little Anarchy

The world of Kubernetes management is experiencing an Operator revolution.

“The Operator pattern aims to capture the key aim of a human operator who is managing a service or set of services.
Human operators who look after specific applications and services have deep knowledge of how the system ought to behave, how to deploy it, and how to react if there are problems.

“People who run workloads on Kubernetes often like to use automation to take care of repeatable tasks.
The Operator pattern captures how you can write code to automate a task beyond what Kubernetes itself provides.”

— https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes Operator Motivation^]

Unfortunately, operators are all too often wresting control away from the mere humans who would manage their own resources.
Most Operators embed their logic in compiled container images.
The typical human systems operator does not program in Go and does not have a container image build pipeline.
Human application operators may have experince with builds, but often do not have cluster administrative rights required to deploy operators.

Anarchy democratizes the potential of the Operator pattern by putting the operator logic in the operator configuration. Users write their own logic in Ansible, which requires little more programming experience than using a command line. Through configuration, the Ansible code is directly controlled at runtime to automate anything you can do in the cluster.
Anarchy makes your cluster truly self-governing.


== Anarchy in Action

TODO - Add example anarchy operator for managing an application with a Helm chart.

== Architecture

image::docs/AnarchyDiagram.png[Anarchy Diagram,545,131]

Each AnarchySubject is managed by an AnarchyGovernor.
Each AnarchyGovernor is configured to run Ansible tasks on a single AnarchyRunner.
AnarchySubjects can have AnarchyActions created to schedule task execution.
AnarchyRuns are created for specific Ansible task execution, for processing an subject event handler, run an action, or handle an action callback event.

image::docs/AnarchyCallbackDiagram.png[Anarchy Diagram,748,338]

. An action defined in the AnarchyGovernor config is scheduled for an AnarchySubject, creating an AnarchyAction
. An AnarchyRun is created to execute the AnarchyAction's tasks
. Ansible in the AnarchyRun calls a Job Template or Survey in Ansible Tower, passing the callback URL and token for the AnarchyAction
. Ansible executing in Ansible Tower calls the AnarchyAction callback
. A new AnarchyRun is created to process the callback from Tower
. The AnarchyRun for the callback updates the status of the AnarchySubject

== Installation

=== OpenShift

. Clone this repo to your local workstation and change directory:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/anarchy.git
cd anarchy
----

. Process the `install-template.yaml` to create anarchy custom resource definitions and related cluster Roles:
+
----
oc process -f install-template.yaml | oc apply -f -
----

. Create a new project namespace to deploy the Anarchy operator:
+
----
oc new-project anarchy-operator
----

. Process the template `deploy-template.yaml` to deploy the Anarchy operator into your namespace.
+
The template requires the parameter `OPERATOR_HOSTNAME`.
This should be a hostname within the domain served by the ingress router.
We recommend using the namespace name as the host name within this domain.
For OpenShift 4, the router ingress domain can be retrived from the `ingresses.config.openshift.io` named `cluster`:
+
----
INGRESS_DOMAIN=$(oc get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}')
oc process \
  -f deploy-template.yaml \
  -p OPERATOR_HOSTNAME=anarchy-operator.$INGRESS_DOMAIN \
| oc apply -n anarchy-operator -f -
----

. Check your to make sure the anarchy-operator pod is running and the default runner starts soon after:
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
anarchy-operator-5f7d7898d7-f6dww        1/1     Running   0          11m
anarchy-runner-default-9767c79b6-vt6b4   1/1     Running   0          12m
----

=== Using Helm

Helm v3 support only.

. Clone this repo to your local workstation and change directory:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/anarchy.git
cd anarchy
----

. Create a namespace in which to deploy the Anarchy operator
+
----
kubectl create namespace anarchy-operator
----

. Install with Helm
+
----
helm install --namespace anarchy-operator anarchy helm/
----
+
Support for Kubernetes ingress is included in the Helm chart, but is currently untested.

== Building the Anarchy Operator and Runner

=== OpenShift

. Set current project namespace to Anarchy operator namespace:
+
----
oc project anarchy-operator
----

. Create a Build Config using the provided template:
+
----
oc process -f build-template.yaml --local | oc apply -n anarchy-operator -f -
----

. Build the anarchy image:
+
----
oc start-build -wF anarchy --from-dir=.
----

. Build the ansible-runner image:
+
----
oc start-build -wF anarchy-runner --from-dir=.
----

. Deploy Anarchy images from build:
+
----
INGRESS_DOMAIN=$(oc get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}')
OPERATOR_IMAGE=$(oc get imagestream anarchy -o jsonpath='{.status.tags[?(@.tag=="latest")].items[0].dockerImageReference}')
RUNNER_IMAGE=$(oc get imagestream anarchy-runner -o jsonpath='{.status.tags[?(@.tag=="latest")].items[0].dockerImageReference}')
oc process \
  -f deploy-template.yaml \
  -p OPERATOR_HOSTNAME=anarchy-operator.$INGRESS_DOMAIN \
  -p OPERATOR_IMAGE=$OPERATOR_IMAGE \
  -p OPERATOR_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY=Always \
  -p RUNNER_IMAGE=$RUNNER_IMAGE \
  -p RUNNER_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY=Always \
| oc apply -n anarchy-operator -f -
----

== Testing

=== OpenShift

. Create test namespace
+
----
oc new-project anarchy-operator-test
----

. Process and apply test server template
+
----
oc process -f test/server/deploy-template.yaml \
  -p ANARCHY_NAMESPACE=anarchy-operator \
  -p ANARCHY_TEST_NAMESPACE=anarchy-operator-test \
| oc apply -f -
----

. Run test playbook
+
----
ANSIBLE_CONFIG=test/ansible.cfg ansible-playbook test/test-playbook.yaml
----

== Anarchy Design

The Anarchy Operator is configured with custom resource types AnarchyAPI and AnarchyGovernor in order to manage AnarchySubject resources.
AnarchyAPI resources define how to communicate with an API endpoint while AnarchyGovernor resources define how to interact with APIs to create and manage AnarchySubject resources.
Each AnarchySubject is managed according to a single AnarchyGovernor.
The AnarchyGovernor defines actions to perform against APIs to instantiate and manage the AnarchySubject.
Each action performed for an AnarchySubject according to the AnarchyGovernor definition is represented as an AnarchyAction custom resource.
An AnarchyAction always begins with an call to an API.
The Anarchy operator listens for callbacks to its own API for events relating to actions such as notifications that an action has completed, or encountered an error.
The AnarchyGovernor defines event handlers for actions which may include scheduling further AnarchyActions to occur for the AnarchySubject.

This repository includes a test suite that demonstrates these capabilities by calling a test API.
The usage of the test suite is explained in the "Testing" section below.
The conceptual overview of the test design is described here.

Let's start with the AnarchySubject definition:

----
apiVersion: anarchy.gpte.redhat.com/v1
kind: AnarchySubject
metadata:
  generateName: test-
  namespace: anarchy-operator
spec:
  desiredState: started <1>
  governor: test <2>
  parameters: <3>
    openshift_release: "4.1"
    aws_region: us-east-1
    repo_version: "3.11"
    subdomain_base_suffix: .example.opentlc.com
----

<1> The desired state of the resource, this is an arbitrary string which should be implemented by the AnarchyGovernor.
<2> The test AnarchySubject references the name of the AnarchyGovernor that will manage it.
<3> Each subject may include a list of parameters to pass to the API, though the governor and API get the final say in how and when the parameters are used.

The test AnarchyGovernor definition is shown here:

----
apiVersion: anarchy.gpte.redhat.com/v1
kind: AnarchyGovernor
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  # Ansible processing for this governor will occur on the default runner.
  runner: default

      tasks:

    # The `update` event is processed when a resource changes.
    update:
